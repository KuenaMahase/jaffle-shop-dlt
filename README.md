# Jaffle Shop DLT Pipeline

This project demonstrates how to deploy a **data pipeline** using [`dlt`](https://github.com/dlt-hub/dlt) and **GitHub Actions** for automation. It extracts, normalizes, and loads data from a sample Jaffle Shop API into a local DuckDB database.

---

## Project Overview

- **Language:** Python  
- **Pipeline Tool:** dlt (Data Loading Tool)  
- **Destination:** DuckDB (file-based analytical database)  
- **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions  
- **Deployment Schedule:** Every 30 minutes via cron

## GitHub Secrets

This project uses **GitHub Actions Secrets** to manage configuration securely.

You must set the following secret in your GitHub repository under:  
`Settings > Secrets and variables > Actions`

| Name                           | Example Value                                |
|--------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| `DESTINATION__DUCKDB__CREDENTIALS` | `duckdb:///optimized_jaffle_pipeline.duckdb` |

---

## ðŸš€ Run the Pipeline Locally

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python jaffle_pipeline.py
````

This will fetch and load data into `optimized_jaffle_pipeline.duckdb`.
